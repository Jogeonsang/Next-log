### The History of Wanted-Insight

Before diving into the technical choice, let‚Äôs briefly summarize the existing situation and history of Wanted-Insight.

Wanted-Insight, acquired by WantedLab in September 2018, lacked code management for over three years until January 2022. Thus, Wanted-Insight's structure remained as it was in 2018, differing from WantedLab's main tech stack and without a clear technical history, creating significant tech debt for the fast-moving Wanted-Insight.

Here's a short example image of how state management was being handled.

Existing project‚Äôs store structure and saga code.

There was no agreed-upon boilerplate in the code.
Managing most operations in a single saga file increased the likelihood of side effects when debugging or modifying code. Detailed problems include:
(Some codes handle API responses through saga, while others use action and reducer - a convoluted code structure...)

### Most APIs Implemented Using a Combination of Redux and Saga

This departs from the design managed through react-query.

### The Issue of Several Sagas Written in One File, Resulting in Over 700 Lines of Jumbled Code

This structure was prone to side effects and had strong code dependencies, making modifications difficult.

### The Problem of Managing Most States with Redux Even When They Could Be Handled as Local States

Based on these issues, we decided to freeze the current Redux structure and use a new state management library for future developments. If there are no problems, we plan to migrate the existing structure as well.

## Conditions Required for the New State Management Library

### Must Have a Low Learning Curve

Introducing a new library means developers, apart from our current team, should be able to contribute with minimal learning costs, especially if they understand Redux.

### The Ecosystem Must Be Established and Already a Part of the React Ecosystem

This is to prevent structural or code changes if the new library is poorly managed or lacks future support.

This brought us to Recoil vs Zustand.
| **Organization** | **Poimandres** | **Meta** |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Weekly downloads <br/> 2023.12.24 ~ 2023.12.31 | 937,542 | 208,330 |
| Bundle Size | 324kb | 2.21mb |
| Major Version | 4.4.7 | 0.7.7 |
| Similar Library | Redux | React Context API |
| TS | O | O (tyeps module support) |
| NextJS | O | O |

We compared the two libraries based on the following criteria, and our Wanted-Insight team chose ‚ÄúZustand.‚Äù

The brief reasons for choosing Zustand are as follows:

1. As of October 2022, Zustand's main download numbers are more than 2.5 times higher (ecosystem perspective).

2. Although developed by Facebook's team, Recoil hasn‚Äôt updated to a major version for over two years since its release, has many issues, and the response to these issues is slow.
   While Recoil‚Äôs ecosystem is growing, it‚Äôs not as steep as Zustand‚Äôs and is comparatively smaller.

3. Zustand allows using hooks as the main means of consuming state, notifying components temporarily without causing rendering.

4. These reasons led us to choose Zustand. (I also have a strong personal liking for Zustand..)

### Core of Zustand and a Brief on How to Use It

The Zustand development team describes its core as follows:

> A small, fast, and scalable bearbones state-management solution using simplified flux principles.

As stated in the core keywords, Zustand is an implementation of the Flux pattern, sharing commonalities with Redux.

Since this article is not about discussing how to use Zustand, I will briefly compare a Toast UI handling state with Redux and conclude the post.

(Please bear with me as this is example code for understanding, not actual business code üôè)

## Toast Handler Implemented with Zustand

### Zustand / Store Creation

```ts:Typescript
export const useToastStore = create<ToastStore>((set, get) => ({
    toastList: new Map(),
    toastShow(content: ToastContent, option?: toastOption) {
        const { toastList } = get();
        const toastId = generatedUUID();
        const newToastList = new Map(toastList);
        const toastOption: ToastOption = { ...option, duration: option.duration };

        newToastList.set(toastId, { content, option: toastOption })

        set({
            toastList: newToastList
        });
    },
    toastClose(toastId: string) {
        const { toastList } = get();

        const newToastList = new Map(toastList);
        newToastList.delete(toastId);

        set({
            toastList: newToastList
        });
    },
    toasdtCloseAll() {
        const newToastList = new Map();

        set({
            toastList: newToastList,
        })
    }
}));
```

### Zustand / Actual Usage Code (hooks)

```tsx:Typescript {1}
    const { toastShow, toastList } = useToastStore();
```

Toast Handler Implemented with Redux
Redux / Action

```tsx:Typescript
// actionType
const SHOW_TOAST = 'toast/SHOW_TOAST' as const;
const CLOSE_TOAST = 'toast/CLOSE_TOAST' as const;
const CLEAR_TOAST = 'toast/CLEAR_TOAST' as const;

// action create function
interface IShowToastProps {
    id: string;
    content: ToastContent;
    option: ToastOption;
}

export showToast = (payload: IShowToastProps) => {
    type: SHOW_TOAST,
    payload
}

export closeToast = (id: string) => {
    type: CLOSE_TOAST,
    payload: id
}

export clearToast = () => {
    type: CLEAR_TOAST,
}

// type for action object
type ToastAction =
    | ReturnType<typeof showToast>
    | ReturnType<typeof closeToast>
    | ReturnType<typeof clearToast>
```

Redux / Reducer

```tsx:Typescript

type ToastState = {
toastList: Map<string, Toast>;
}

const initialState: ToastState = {
toastList: new Map()
}

// reducers
function toast(
    state: ToastState = initialState;
    action: ToastAction
):ToastState {
    switch(action.type) {
        case SHOW_TOAST:
            const { id, content, options } = action.payload;
            const { toastList } = state;
            const newToastList = new Map(toastList);
            const toastOption: ToastOption =  { ...option, duration: option?.duration ?? 3500 };

            newToastList.set(id, { content, option: toastOption });

            return { toastList: newToastList };

        case CLOSE_TOAST:
            const { toastList } = state;
            const newToastList = new Map(toastList);
            newToastList.delete(action.payload.id);

            return { toastList: newToastList };

        case CLEAR_TOAST:
            const newToastList = new Map();

            return { toastList: newToastList };

        default:
            return state;
    }
}

export default toast;
```

Redux / Actual Usage Code

```tsx:Typescript
const toastList = useSelector((state: RootState) => state.toastList);
const dispatch = useDispatch();

// action dispatch function
const showTaost = (content: ToastContent, option: ToastOption) => {
    const id = generateUUD();
    const payload = {
        id,
        content,
        option
    }

    dispatch(showToast(payload));
};

const closeToast = (id: string) => {
    dispatch(closeToast(id));
};

const clearToast = () => {
    dispatch(clearToast());
};
```

I‚Äôve written the same logic using both the existing Redux and the newly adopted Zustand.

What do you think? Implementing the same logic, Zustand allows us to write code with lesser cost.

This was a significant advantage for us, and being able to use existing Redux devtools and various 3rd-Party Libraries for advanced state management was also appealing.

### Wanted-Insight‚Äôs Global State Management Rules

How does Wanted-Insight manage state management after switching to Zustand? We changed the structure that was handling APIs with Redux Saga as follows:

1. Migrated API handling from Redux Saga to react-query.
2. Managed business logic that can be handled as a local state, not necessarily as a global state, using local state.
3. Managed values that must be handled globally (User, Toast, Modal, Environment, etc.).
   We succeeded in migrating the existing Redux structure code to Zustand by adhering to these rules.

Finally, I‚Äôll conclude this post with thoughts from team members who‚Äôve been using Zustand for three months.

### How Does It Feel Different from Using Redux?

Mr. Kibaek: It‚Äôs too easy. With Redux, we had to decide on ancillary things at the code and architecture levels, but Zustand is surprisingly easy to set up and lightweight.

Mr. Geonsang: The fact that global state management is achieved with a lesser amount of code was a significant difference for me. As Mr. Gibaek mentioned, the lack of a Provider makes the setup simple and lightweight, which I appreciated.

### Are You Satisfied with Using Zustand?

Mr. Kibaek: I am. It's so easy that you don‚Äôt have to set it up with a heavy heart like Redux. Plus, the community is quite active, and the library is well-maintained, which adds to the satisfaction.

Mr. Geonsang: Although Redux has a larger ecosystem, Zustand's similar operation style means a low learning curve, and the unexpectedly large community helps easily resolve any issues. (And the bear is cute too.)

Conclusion
Every team has its rules and an amount of technical debt it can handle.

Our team thought it was too significant a tech debt to carry during a time when we needed to rapidly expand our service. So, based on the above problems, we decided to establish a new state management method with Zustand. This change, we believe, has resolved potential issues caused by tech debt in service expansion and maintenance, greatly benefiting the business.

I‚Äôd like to thank my frontend team members for their efforts in creating a good system and for supporting the right thing.
